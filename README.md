Sales and Charge Accounts Menu

In this project you will be creating a program that will perform multiple functions:

Sales, and Charge Accounts

You should create a main menu that offers access to the Sales section, the Charge Account section or Exit.

1. Sales

1a. Using the Sales.txt file that will read the file and insert the data into an array.

1b. Provide a submenu option in the Sales Section to add an new entry into the array and store it on the text file or quit and go back to the main menu, verify the entry is a valid number, then add it to the array.

1c. Provide a submenu option in the Sales Section to display the average of the values in the array.

1d. Provide a submenu option in the Sales Section to display the largest value in the array.

1e. Provide a submenu option in the Sales Section to display the smallest value in the array.

1f. Provide a submenu option to return to the top level menu.

2.  Charge Accounts

2a. Using the ChargeAccounts.txt read the contents of the file into an array.

2b. The application should allow the user to enter a 7 digit number (all charge account numbers are 7 digits), if it is less then 7 or greater than 7 the application should indicate that this is not valid and request a new number, if it is not a number the application should also advise invalid entry and request a new number or return to top level menu.

2c. Once the user inputs a valid number the application will verify that it is a valid charge account number by searching for it within the array. 

2d. If the number is valid, that is, it is contained in the array, display a message advising it is valid and request another or return to top level menu

2e. If the number is not found display a message advising it is not a valid charge account number and request another or return to top level menu.

2f. Provide the ability to add a new charge account number, it must be 7 digits long and does not already exist in the array, plus it must add the new number to the text file.
